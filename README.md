Introduction
The ZMPT101B is an AC voltage sensor that can be used to measure AC voltage levels. When combined with an ESP32 microcontroller, it becomes a powerful tool for various applications such as:

Home automation systems
Power monitoring and management
IoT projects
Smart appliances
This repository provides example code and instructions on how to connect and use the ZMPT101B sensor with the ESP32.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your ESP32 development board.

Prerequisites
Arduino IDE: You'll need the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

ESP32 Board Support: Make sure you have added ESP32 board support to your Arduino IDE. You can do this by following the official guide from Espressif.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/esp32-zmpt101b.git
Open the Arduino IDE.

Open the Arduino sketch (.ino) file located in the src directory of this repository.

Select the appropriate ESP32 board from the "Tools" menu > "Board."

Select the correct COM port for your ESP32 board from the "Tools" menu > "Port."

Click the "Upload" button to compile and upload the code to your ESP32 board.

Usage
This section should include instructions on how to use the code and hardware components to measure AC voltage using the ZMPT101B sensor and ESP32. Provide examples, code snippets, and wiring diagrams if necessary.
